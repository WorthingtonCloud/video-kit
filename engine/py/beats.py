"""Find a track's beat grid: how long one beat is, and when the first big hit lands.
Every cut in the reel sits on this grid, and the reel's opening runs until the first hit.

    vs beats music/take1.mp3            print the grid, the candidate hits, and a loudness sketch
    vs beats music/take1.mp3 --write    also save it into reel.json → "music"
    vs beats music/take1.mp3 --hit 8.3  use a hit you picked by ear (with --write to save it)

Needs numpy (pip install numpy). It measures, it can't hear: the person listening decides which hit is "the" hit.
